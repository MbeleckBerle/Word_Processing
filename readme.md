This program reads the files and returns the sentence with the largest number of
n-grams on the first requirement

- Do not run the python file directly on it's own!! else it will give the error
  "[Errno 2] No such file or directory:"

- it is important to leave the folders as they are and not move the text files
  out of the "Nouns" folder. doing this will not allow the program to locate
  where they are.
